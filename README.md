## BELAY ON!

This is the GMS source code to a game created by me and a friend for the 
2021 GMTK Game Jam. We had 48 hours to complete a game with the theme 
"Joined Together", so we decided to make a climb about rock climbing, 
where you control both the climber and the belayer.

To build, you must have a copy of Game Maker Studio installed. Then, 
just open the project file.
